\chapter*{Executive Summary}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Executive Summary}
Synth Net is a project that integrates four microcontrollers (two ESP32s, an Arduino Uno, and an Arduino Mega) connected via I2C communication on a single breadboard. The primary goal of Synth Net is to achieve efficient bidirectional communication between these devices, overcoming the limitations of existing libraries. Each microcontroller has a specific role: one ESP32 acts as the master, managing the overall communication, the Arduino Mega displays collected information in a custom interface, another ESP32 retrieves weather data through an API, and the Arduino Uno gathers environmental data using sensor modules. This project not only posed significant technical challenges but also served as a personal source of motivation during a difficult period of health.

% 4. Introduction (Introducción)
\chapter{Introduction}
After enduring a challenging year with health issues related to cancer, I felt the need to engage in a project that would present a fun and stimulating challenge while helping me regain a sense of purpose. Synth Net was born out of this need, serving as both an exploration into I2C communication across multiple microcontrollers and a platform to showcase my work in my first science fair.

The decision to work with I2C communication was intentional, given its complexity. Managing a bus with multiple devices and writing approximately 1,500 lines of code introduced unique challenges, particularly with library compatibility and conflicts. However, overcoming these obstacles allowed me to dive deeper into advanced microcontroller concepts and serial communication techniques.

The core objective of Synth Net was to establish efficient bidirectional communication within a system composed of four microcontrollers, using libraries that did not natively support this functionality. Custom functions were developed to enable smooth integration and coordination between the components.
\section{Motivation}
Explanation of the importance of the addressed challenge, for example, the need for low-cost environmental monitoring systems.

\section{Objectives}
\subsection{General Objective}
The primary goal of Synth Net is to develop an integrated system that enables efficient bidirectional communication between four microcontrollers—two ESP32 units, an Arduino Uno, and an Arduino Mega—using the I2C protocol. This system overcomes the inherent limitations of standard libraries by implementing custom functions tailored to support complex communication scenarios across multiple devices. The project seeks to optimize data exchange, processing, and display, creating a cohesive network where each microcontroller performs distinct, yet interdependent, roles.

\subsection{Specific Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Configure two ESP32 microcontrollers, an Arduino Uno, and an Arduino Mega on a shared breadboard, establishing a robust I2C communication architecture.
    \item Assign distinct roles to each microcontroller: one ESP32 will act as the master controlling the communication flow, the Arduino Mega will handle data visualization, the second ESP32 will retrieve real-time weather data via an API, and the Arduino Uno will gather environmental data through attached sensors.
    \item Develop custom I2C communication functions that facilitate seamless bidirectional data transmission between the devices, effectively bypassing the limitations imposed by standard libraries.
    \item Design and implement a custom graphical interface on the Arduino Mega that organizes and displays the collected data in a clear and user-friendly manner.
    \item Conduct comprehensive testing to ensure the system’s stability, reliability, and seamless integration of all components, addressing potential hardware and software challenges.
\end{itemize}

% 6. Theoretical Framework (Marco Teórico)
\chapter{Theoretical Framework}
This section presents the key concepts used in the Synth Net project, such as microcontrollers, the I2C communication protocol, and climate API integration.

\section{Microcontrollers}

ESP32: A high-performance microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, the ESP32 is well-suited for applications that require wireless connectivity. Its powerful dual-core processor and abundant I/O options make it an ideal choice for managing complex tasks like coordinating a network of multiple devices.
Arduino Uno and Mega: These popular microcontrollers, based on the ATmega328P (Uno) and ATmega2560 (Mega), are widely used due to their simplicity, large community support, and compatibility with a variety of sensors and modules. The Mega, with its increased memory and input/output pins, is ideal for handling more intensive tasks such as graphical data display.

\section{I2C Communication}
The I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) protocol is a synchronous serial communication standard that allows multiple devices to communicate with one another using just two lines: SDA (data) and SCL (clock). Designed for efficient and reliable data transfer between microcontrollers and peripherals, I2C operates in a master-slave configuration. In Synth Net, the ESP32 serves as the master, directing communication between the microcontrollers and ensuring that data is transmitted and received without conflict, even in a highly concurrent system.

\section{Climate APIs}
The integration of external APIs, such as OpenWeather, enables the system to access real-time weather information. Using HTTP requests, the ESP32 retrieves JSON-formatted data, which is then parsed and optimized for minimal memory usage. Efficient serialization and deserialization are critical to ensure that only essential data is transmitted over the I2C bus, maintaining optimal system performance while minimizing overhead.

\chapter{Synth Net System Description}
\section{General Architecture}
Synth Net consists of four microcontrollers interconnected on a single breadboard, utilizing the I2C protocol for communication. The architecture is designed in a master-slave configuration, where one ESP32 functions as the master and coordinates communication between the other devices. This architecture enables seamless data exchange and integration between the microcontrollers, each performing distinct tasks critical to the overall system functionality.

(A block diagram illustrating the interconnection between the microcontrollers and their specific roles will be inserted here.)
\section{Roles of Each Component}
\subsection{ESP32 Master}
Functions and Responsibilities:
Manages I2C communication between all devices, acting as the central coordinator.
Hosts a local web server that provides an alternative method for data input, allowing users to interact with the system remotely.
Handles requests and responses from the slave devices, ensuring smooth data flow and execution of tasks.
\subsection{Arduino Mega}
Functions and Responsibilities:
Responsible for rendering graphical elements such as logos and managing variables for display.
Displays a custom interface built in C, which presents the collected data in a clear, organized format. The interface facilitates real-time monitoring of system performance and environmental conditions.

\subsection{ESP32 with Climate API}
Data Integration and Retrieval:
Connects to the internet via Wi-Fi to retrieve real-time weather data through the OpenWeather API.
Parses the received JSON data and optimizes it by reducing the number of bytes, minimizing memory and storage usage, and ensuring efficient data transfer over the I2C bus.
\subsection{Arduino Uno}
Environmental Data Collection:
Gathers environmental data using connected sensor modules, such as temperature and humidity sensors.
Sends the collected data to the ESP32 master for further processing and visualization on the Arduino Mega.

\section{Connections and Communication}
The communication between microcontrollers is established using the I2C protocol, with each device connected to the SDA (data) and SCL (clock) lines. These two lines facilitate bidirectional data transfer, allowing the ESP32 master to coordinate the flow of information between the microcontrollers. Custom functions were developed to optimize communication efficiency and resolve potential conflicts between libraries, ensuring stable operation under varying workloads.
